Twitter Clone :

                Let's make simple Twitter. Users can post tweets and see everyone's them.
                To make the project simple, we do not have a sign/login function.
                So there are not user accounts and follow function. You can challenge after you finish the course.





Tech used :

          * Html
          * Css
          * Bootstrap
